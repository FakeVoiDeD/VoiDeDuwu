🧠 About Me

Hey, I’m VoiDeD a night-shift developer and problem solver who’s always building smarter systems and experimenting with AI, automation, and clean web experiences.

I’m currently working on a CRM system designed for cold call centers focused on simplicity, efficiency, and real-world usability. I enjoy combining AI tools with modern web development to streamline workflows and modernize old systems.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually exploring design ideas, tweaking automation setups, or diving into how data flows and connects. I like clean structure whether it’s in databases (SQL ❤️), code, or UI.

⚙️ Tech Interests

Web Development: modern, fast, minimalistic
AI & Automation: building tools that think and adapt
Databases: SQL-first approach for clarity and structure
System Design: scalable, maintainable backend logic

🎧 Side Interests

Music fuels my focus and keep me in the zone.
and I’ve got an eye for minimalist art and tattoo design.

🚀 What I’m Building

A cold-call CRM platform (custom-built, clean UI, SQL-backed)
Integrations for AI-assisted workflows
Personal projects that push simplicity and efficiency in web tools
